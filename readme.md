## About

This package is a very simple interface to display all routes in your webapplication. Instead of using the command line, you can pay a visit at yourdomain.com/development/routes. An interface with several options will appear.

## Possibilities
- Add search terms
- Display columns bases on your preferences.
- Search in each column
- Sort ASC/DESC

**Search a route:** use a + sign to search for multiple words. I.e.: User + Shop. There is no limit for the + sign.

## Installation

Run the command`composer require codetechnl/route-interface`

After installing publish the assets and config: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=route-interface --force`
